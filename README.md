# README #
A collection of Euler problems, currently implemented in python. For private
use, please try to solve these problems on your own! At the very least, look up
the mathematics and then implement them yourself. It's all in the name of fun
and practice :smiley:.

## WIP ##

### Food for thought ###
* p5 - consider the Sieve algorithm in next revision, can tackle [yuge ranges][].

    [yuge ranges]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11493585

* p7 - runs over 1 min, consider dynamic sieve
